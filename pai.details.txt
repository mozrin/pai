There is an architectural problem here ..

The splash_screen.dart needs to be isolated from the rest of the interfaces.

We need to throw this screen up BEFORE colors and themes and configuration ... 
BEFORE everything is loaded so that it can tell us about the loading process.

So ... the main BEFORE the RunApp process ... needs to:

throw up the splash_screen
load everything through the await startup_process() which updates the splash_screen
and then do the runapp and launch the main processes
